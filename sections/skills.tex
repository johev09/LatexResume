\section{Technical Skills}
\vspace{3pt}
As a software engineer with over 7 years of real-world experience, I have designed and delivered several large-scale \textbf{distributed systems} of \textbf{microservices} that handle high traffic from millions of customers. Through these projects, I have gained expertise in every stage of \textbf{Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)} and consistently focused on \textbf{operational excellence}. I have learned to improve code performance, readability, modularity, and extensibility by applying best practices of \textbf{software design patterns}. I have learned to make services more resilient and fault tolerant through design choices like \textbf{availability zone replication}, \textbf{distributed rate-limiting / throttling}, and \textbf{circuit-breaker}. I have built diverse monitor solutions for these systems through auto-generated \textbf{metrics}, \textbf{alarms} and \textbf{dashboards}. I have adopted efficient DevOps approaches for safely auto-deploying changes to production by following the standard practices of \textbf{Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline}, including \textbf{Integration Testing}, \textbf{Stress Testing}, \textbf{Chaos Testing}, \textbf{OneBox stages}, \textbf{Rollback}, and more.

Beyond work, I enjoy exploring the latest developments in \textbf{Machine Learning (ML)}, \textbf{Web Dev}, and \textbf{System Design}, which inspires me to develop new ideas. Some of my skills and experiences are mentioned below.
