\section{Technical Skills}
\vspace{3pt}
As a software engineer with over 7 years of real-world experience, I have designed and delivered various large-scale \textbf{distributed systems} involving \textbf{microservices}, web applications, and workflows that continuously serve high peak traffic from millions of customers. Through these projects, I have gained expertise in every stage of \textbf{Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)} maintaining high standards in \textbf{operational excellence}. I have learned to improve code performance, readability, modularity, and extensibility by applying best practices of \textbf{software design patterns}. I have learned to make services more \textbf{resilient and fault tolerant} through design choices like availability zone replication, distributed rate-limiting / throttling, and circuit-breaker. I have built diverse \textbf{monitoring solutions} for these systems through auto-generated metrics, alarms, and dashboards. I have adopted efficient \textbf{DevOps} approaches for safe auto-deployment of changes to production by following the standard practices of \textbf{Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline}, including \textbf{Integration Testing}, \textbf{Stress Testing}, \textbf{Chaos Testing}, \textbf{OneBox stages}, \textbf{Rollback}, and more.

Beyond work, I enjoy exploring the latest developments in \textbf{Machine Learning (ML)}, \textbf{Web Dev}, and \textbf{System Design}, which inspires me to develop new ideas. Some of my skills and experiences are mentioned below.
