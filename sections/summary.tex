\justifying{As a member of the Prime Tech Team at Amazon, I build tech solutions that improve the user experience of Prime customers worldwide. With over 7 years of industry experience in software engineering, I have delivered several large-scale projects that exceeded business goals and pushed the technical boundaries of distributed systems withstanding the massive demand of millions of customers non-stop.
