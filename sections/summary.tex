\justifying{As a member of the Amazon Prime Tech Team, I design and build tech solutions that improve the user experience for Prime customers globally. As a software engineer with over 7 years of real-world experience, I have led several large-scale projects at Amazon that exceeded business goals and pushed the technical boundaries of distributed systems to support requests from millions of customers. The part I most enjoy about work is diving into the low-levels of software or operating systems down to thread, kernel or even CPU operations to debug or fine-tune systems.}
