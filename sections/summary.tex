\justifying{As a member of the Amazon Prime Tech Team, I design and build tech solutions that improve the user experience of Prime customers worldwide. As a software engineer with over 7 years of industry experience, I have led several high-impactful projects at Amazon, exceeding business goals as well as pushing the technical boundaries of distributed services, to serve the massive demand of millions of customers.
