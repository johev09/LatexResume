\justifying{As a member of the Amazon Prime Tech Team, I design and build tech solutions that improve the user experience for Prime customers globally. As a software engineer with over 7 years of real-world experience, I have led several large-scale projects at Amazon that exceeded business goals and pushed the technical boundaries of distributed systems to support requests of millions of customers. However, my core interest lies in exploring the interesting low-level details of software and operating systems, down to thread and kernel-level operations.}
